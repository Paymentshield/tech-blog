We are the technology department of Paymentshield. Hi!

At Paymentshield, we're one of the UK's leading insurance administrators and distributors. Working with some of the UK's best known insurers, we deliver premium products and services to financial advisers and their clients.

To make all of this happen, we need a team of creative, innovative problem solvers. We write code and create digital experiences that make it as easy as possible for our customers to get protected, and we create the systems that make insurance happen in the background. We like to think of it as "building the shield".

This blog is all about the team, the technology, and the techniques that make it all work. Hopefully you enjoy reading about our journey as much as we do creating it!
